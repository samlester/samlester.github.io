Hello. I'm Sam, a designer and developer living and working in East London.

I graduated from Brunel University in 2013 with a Multimedia Technology and Design degree and promptly co-founded [Inktrap](http://www.inktrap.co.uk), a new design studio which creates brilliant apps and websites, mainly for early-stage tech startups. We're a tiny company so my role combines lots of different things including interface design, development, prototyping and project management.

Previously I was a developer/designer at [Ten4 Design](http://www.ten4design.co.uk), leading the development of major projects for clients like Sony Music, ITV, James Grant and Southbank Centre.

When Iâ€™m not designing or developing something I enjoy pale ale, sandwiches and cycling around the Olympic Park.
